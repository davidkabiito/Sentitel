1024	1	airtel decided to get in touch and cement their lie i had used gb of the gb they gave me i really feel cheated and a angry and these god forsaken people are making a fool out of me the difference is gb and fuck i paid for it and i want it 
1025	1	i was submitting my work and needed more internet i went to an airtel service center and before i buy data i wanted to be sure i made an inquiry and the attendant showed me i only got gb on the th of april now if this isnt thuggery and making a fool of people
