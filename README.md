Sentitel
================
### Summary
We use word sequence representation and bag of words (BOW) to extract fine-grained information from social media opinions about telecoms in Uganda. We extract descriptors from the opinions and use them to create a structured summary that can be used for further analysis to gain insights from the opinions. For example the services that subscribers are complaining most about. The social media sites under consideration are [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) and [Facebook](https://web.facebook.com/). The descriptors extracted include the target telecom, aspect and the sentiment towards the aspect. This level of sentiment analysis is refered to as Targeted Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (T-ABSA).
